# Breakout Group 3 Project Ideas

One idea is to interact with the Fitbit API to create a customizeable dashboard to display data in more accessible and personalized ways than Fitbit provides.

Another idea is an application for RPI students that uses the Google Maps API to display local shops and restaurants in Troy. Users could also interact with the app to add ratings and reviews, along with other information such as if they offer student discounts.

Another idea is a graphics library for languages such as either c++ or Java. It would be an introductionary library similar to processing5.js. It would be for people who are just getting started in learning computer graphics and would allow them to build up their skills for graphic processing.

One idea building off on the first one is to also incorporate data from the fitness app built into mobile phones through their APIs (if available) and then be able to maybe set custom goals or milestones that the custom dashboard could then track.

Another idea is a lightweight CI/CL system for building and testing projects over a distributed network. This could be similar to the open source project Bazel, but lighter and more customizable.

Another is to implement a safety feature when a website is detected as a fake site trying to collect passwords from users. It would be similar to the open source project Password Alert however instead of only focusing on Google login pages it could detect more pages. Instead of focusing on where a password was detected (for instance, different sites that have already stolen the password), this would focus on warning users before hand.

One other idea is an accounting tracker application that will keep track of expenses by the user (initially most likely via manual input). The app would also be able to track monthly/yearly subscriptions, and additionally have a calendar where the user can note down any upcoming expenses.
