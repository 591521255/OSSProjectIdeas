# Breakout Group 3 Project Ideas

One idea is to interact with the Fitbit API to create a customizeable dashboard to display data in more accessible and personalized ways than Fitbit provides.

Another idea is an application for RPI students that uses the Google Maps API to display local shops and restaurants in Troy. Users could also interact with the app to add ratings and reviews, along with other information such as if they offer student discounts.
