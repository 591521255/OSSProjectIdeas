# Breakout Group 3 Project Ideas

One idea is to interact with the Fitbit API to create a customizeable dashboard to display data in more accessible and personalized ways than Fitbit provides.

Another idea is an application for RPI students that uses the Google Maps API to display local shops and restaurants in Troy. Users could also interact with the app to add ratings and reviews, along with other information such as if they offer student discounts.

Another idea is a graphics library for languages such as either c++ or Java. It would be an introductionary library similar to processing5.js. It would be for people who are just getting started in learning computer graphics and would allow them to build up their skills for graphic processing.

One idea building off on the first one is to also incorporate data from the fitness app built into mobile phones through their APIs (if available) and then be able to maybe set custom goals or milestones that the custom dashboard could then track.
