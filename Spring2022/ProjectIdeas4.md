Brian Lin: A project idea I have is a file converter that's able to change formats of files to other formats easily.

Mindy Yip: My project idea is a web application that allows people to meet others from their school. They can create a bio and add pictures and other peoples can look at their profile and start up a conversation.

John: Since I know nothing about this project. A simple resolution upscaler?

Joey: An IOS game

Nathan Whitney: People at RPI don't go outside enough and that's doubled by COVID-19.

This new app is called bench of the day which uses random bench locations on campus as a "target" to get to and earn points.
This mixes the "Pokemon Go" like chance randomly meet new people with with a funny way to explore campus.
