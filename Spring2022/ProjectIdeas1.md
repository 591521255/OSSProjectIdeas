1) Travel

Kevin Cruz: Something related to either music or food

Stephanie Li: I'd like to evaluate Submitty as my open source project. I have already contributed to the project in previous semesters for RCOS, so this will give me more time to focus on feature development or code refactoring rather than on onboarding / setting up my development environment. I also like that it means I'm working on a product that I myself am using daily, so I can think both like a developer and a user! This semester, my plan is to work on improving CSV uploads for course management in the instructor UI. I want to add the ability for instructors to download a snapshot of their course classlist into a CSV form for recordkeeping, as well as add more columns (such as ability to specify rotating sections) in a classlist CSV upload. This introduces more columns to an already large CSV, so I would also like to work on allowing optional column headers on these uploads.

Otto Daniels: I think a vitual assistant represented as an animated on screen character like an advanced version of Bonzi Buddy without all the spyware would be neat. Also basically every navy strategy game that takes place after 1900 sucks. I almost want to try and create my own out of sheer spite. 

Nick Lennox: I would like to evaluate and contribute to open-source Rocket League mods that were created by enthusiasts of the game with a background in software development. Their current open source SDK allows for plugins to be built on top of their mod which is appealing to me because I've been a long-time RL player.
