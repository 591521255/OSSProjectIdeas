Kevin Cruz: Something related to either music or food

Stephanie Li: I'd like to evaluate Submitty as my open source project. I have already contributed to the project in previous semesters for RCOS, so this will give me more time to focus on feature development or code refactoring rather than on onboarding / setting up my development environment. I also like that it means I'm working on a product that I myself am using daily, so I can think both like a developer and a user! This semester, my plan is to work on improving CSV uploads for course management in the instructor UI. I want to add the ability for instructors to download a snapshot of their course classlist into a CSV form for recordkeeping, as well as add more columns (such as ability to specify rotating sections) in a classlist CSV upload. This introduces more columns to an already large CSV, so I would also like to work on allowing optional column headers on these uploads.
