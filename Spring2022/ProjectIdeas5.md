### Javier Portorreal

I want to work on a project that revolves around web development. I will most likley choose to continue to work on Submitty. Ive been contributing for almost 2 years now and I would like to wrap up a few features I have been working on. I graduate this semester and I think it would be the best use of my time. Joining a new project means I have to onboard all over again. I am currently working on a huge change to Late Days that is still a WIP so I plan to finish that.

One idea I have is to continue working on a web application that was started in my Software Design and Documentation class that is still in very early development. I would also like to try and work on a project relating to Machine Learning as I have no experience, but am very interested in learning.
