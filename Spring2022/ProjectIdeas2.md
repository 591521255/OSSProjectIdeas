I don't have any specific ideas yet, I just know I want to work on something with Javascript, I think. Probably a Node.js module

I want to work on a screen capturing software that allows users to share their content with each other with privacy controls. This idea is to replicate Streamable, NVIDIA's GeForce Experience tool, ShareX, and Lightshot.

## Elise Kulka

I would be interested in working on a project that improves efficiency. For example, I like [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) because the efficiency of code reviews is improved by allowing users to hold code reviews inside a Git repository. Something similar might be interesting to work on.
