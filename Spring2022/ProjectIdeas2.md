I don't have any specific ideas yet, I just know I want to work on something with Javascript, I think. Probably a Node.js module

I want to work on a screen capturing software that allows users to share their content with each other with privacy controls. This idea is to replicate Streamable, NVIDIA's GeForce Experience tool, ShareX, and Lightshot.

I'm not fully sure what I'll be doing yet, but I've been interested in the Magenta open source project that's built upon TensorFlow. It uses machine learning to train machine learning models using data and creating various forms of art.

I would be interested in working on a project that improves efficiency. For example, I like [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) because the efficiency of code reviews is improved by allowing users to hold code reviews inside a Git repository. Something similar might be interesting to work on.

## Anthony Jin

I would probably work on something I've been working on in RCOS called OED (Open Energy Dashboard). If there is an interesting project that gets presented, I might choose those projects instead. Preferably something web-development oriented, though it would be fun to learn languages for mobile apps or games.
