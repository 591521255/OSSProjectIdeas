# Simple Calendar/Task Managing program
I'm usually really disorganized when it comes to keeping track of
homeworks/exams, so I think it'd be a good idea to develop a lightweight task
app (hopefully with an Android/iOS widget for easy access). Something to help
centralize important tasks and maybe even have a priority system.
