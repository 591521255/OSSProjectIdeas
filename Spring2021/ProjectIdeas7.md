# Simple Calendar/Task Managing program (Nick Yao)
I'm usually really disorganized when it comes to keeping track of
homeworks/exams, so I think it'd be a good idea to develop a lightweight task
app (hopefully with an Android/iOS widget for easy access). Something to help
centralize important tasks and maybe even have a priority system.

# RateMyProfessors for Landlords in Troy (Serena Chen)
On the RPI subreddit, there was a post about having an app similar to 
RateMyProfesssors but for landlords in the Troy area. The student(s) who 
made this post have already been working on this project, but as of now, it's
not out for the public yet, and I don't think it's open source (I couldn't
find any source code). I think it would be cool to make this an open source 
app, as it is something many RPI students would be interested in.
