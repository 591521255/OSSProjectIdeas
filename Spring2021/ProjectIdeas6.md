Trevor's idea is for a site or program with which you can keep track of what ingredients you have laying around and what recipes you know how to make. The software would then show you which recipes you know that you have the ingredients for. Recipes could also be shared, and there could be a feature to help generate shopping lists based on what you want to make.
